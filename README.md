# VBA-Challenge
In this homework, I created a script that loops through four different worksheets containing stock data, it outputs the following information:

*Ticker symbol

*Quarterly opening price to closing price from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter

*Percentage change of opening price to closing price from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter

*Total stock volume per ticker symbol

*Greatest percent increase

*Greatest percent decrease

*Greatest total volume
