# VBA-Challenge
In this homework, I created a script that loops through four different worksheets containing stock data, it outputs the following information:

*Ticker symbol
*Quarterly opening price to closing price from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter
*Percentage change of opening price to closing price from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter
*Total stock volume per ticker symbol
*Greatest percent increase
*Greatest percent decrease
*Greatest total volume
